## ðŸ¤” What it Does

When interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) or AI chatbots, providing relevant context is crucial for getting good results. `packUp4AI` helps you gather this context directly from your Obsidian vault.

Starting from your currently open note, it:

1.  **Collects:** Finds notes linked *from* and optionally *to* your starting note, going out to a specified number of "hops" (Collection Depth).
2.  **Visualizes:** Displays an interactive graph showing the relationships between the collected notes. Nodes are sized based on their word count.
3.  **Stats:** Shows you how many notes were collected and provides basic word count statistics (total, average, range).
4.  **Exports:** Allows you to easily copy this context bundle to your clipboard or save it as a new Markdown file in your vault.

This makes it much easier to copy-paste relevant information from your vault into your favorite AI tool.
